The Indian captain’s batting record is hardly matched by any other cricketer on the planet, with his aggressive approach to the game also making him a player fans flock to watch.</p>
            <p>Kohli always dreamed of representing his country in cricket and had his first opportunity as a teenager when he played for the India under-19 team in 2006, guiding the same team to a World Cup win in 2008.</p>
            <p>His senior international career took off soon after when Kohli made his one-day international debut against Sri Lanka in August 2008. He now has more than 35 one-day hundreds and many other fine performances to his name, with a high-score of 183 against Pakistan in 2012. He averages more than 50 in 50-over cricket.</p>
            <p>Kohli has been equally as impressive in the five-day game. He averages over 50 and has made 17 centuries and 14 fifties in 59 Tests. As of January 2019, he was the #1 ranked batsman in the world in both the ODI and Test formats.</p>
            <p>Kohli’s brilliance with the bat is matched by his skills as a captain in all three forms of the game. While a major tournament win still eludes the Indian’s under his leadership, the side has regularly held the #1 world ranking in both Test and ODI cricket. He has the greatest Test Match winning percentage as an Indian captain, with a most recent triumph being a 2-1 series victory against Australia – the first ever Indian series win on Australian soil.</p>
